The USDA has a database of nutritional information for many foods available at:

  http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964

By default it's contained in flat files. This project includes scripts to generate appropriate schema and import them into a SQL database. It's been tested with SQLite but it will probably work with other systems with minimal modification.

You will need to first download the files and unzip them into the data directory, e.g. for release SR24

  cd data
  wget http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR24/dnload/sr24.zip
  unzip sr24.zip

For convenience I've included the data files for SR24 in the data directory.
